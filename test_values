CVE-2018-3810	2018-01-01T01:29:00.217-05:00	2018-01-16T13:38:11.573-05:00	Authentication Bypass vulnerability in the Oturia Smart Google Code Inserter plugin before 3.5 for WordPress allows unauthenticated attackers to insert arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code (via the sgcgoogleanalytic parameter) that runs on all pages served by WordPress. The saveGoogleCode() function in smartgooglecode.php does not check if the current request is made by an authorized user, thus allowing any unauthenticated user to successfully update the inserted code.
CVE-2018-3811	2018-01-01T01:29:00.247-05:00	2018-01-16T13:39:22.920-05:00	SQL Injection vulnerability in the Oturia Smart Google Code Inserter plugin before 3.5 for WordPress allows unauthenticated attackers to execute SQL queries in the context of the web server. The saveGoogleAdWords() function in smartgooglecode.php did not use prepared statements and did not sanitize the $_POST["oId"] variable before passing it as input into the SQL query.
CVE-2018-5210	2018-01-04T01:29:00.497-05:00	2018-01-29T08:02:31.227-05:00	On Samsung mobile devices with N(7.x) software and Exynos chipsets, attackers can conduct a Trustlet stack overflow attack for arbitrary TEE code execution, in conjunction with a brute-force attack to discover unlock information (PIN, password, or pattern). The Samsung ID is SVE-2017-10733.
CVE-2018-5283	2018-01-08T04:29:00.370-05:00	2018-01-29T07:33:00.747-05:00	The Photos in Wifi application 1.0.1 for iOS has directory traversal via the ext parameter to assets-library://asset/asset.php.
CVE-2018-5332	2018-01-11T02:29:00.217-05:00	2018-05-03T21:29:13.817-04:00	In the Linux kernel through 4.14.13, the rds_message_alloc_sgs() function does not validate a value that is used during DMA page allocation, leading to a heap-based out-of-bounds write (related to the rds_rdma_extra_size function in net/rds/rdma.c).
CVE-2018-5333	2018-01-11T02:29:00.263-05:00	2018-05-03T21:29:13.940-04:00	In the Linux kernel through 4.14.13, the rds_cmsg_atomic function in net/rds/rdma.c mishandles cases where page pinning fails or an invalid address is supplied, leading to an rds_atomic_free_op NULL pointer dereference.
CVE-2018-5262	2018-01-12T12:29:01.117-05:00	2018-01-29T07:26:03.157-05:00	A stack-based buffer overflow in Flexense DiskBoss 8.8.16 and earlier allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code in the context of a highly privileged account.
